          agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes
          expressly provided below) informally for at least thirty (30) days
          before initiating arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence
          upon written notice from one Party to the other Party.

        <h2 className="text-[19px]">Binding Arbitration</h2>
        <p className="text-[18px] leading-[29px]">
          If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal
          negotiations, the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded
          below) will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding
          arbitration. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under
          the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
          Association ("AAA") and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary
          Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes ("AAA Consumer Rules"), both
          of which are available at the AAA website www.adr.org. Except where
          otherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or applicable law, the
          arbitration will take place in USA County, California.

        <h2 className="text-[19px]">Venue</h2>
        <p className="text-[18px] leading-[29px]">
          By waiving all the conflict of laws, the state and federal courts
          located in USA County, California is the venue of competent
          jurisdiction for this Agreement, whereby both Parties waive all
          defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction, and forum non conveniens
          with respect to venue and jurisdiction in such state and federal
          courts.

        <br />
        <h2 className="text-[19px]">Limitation</h2>
        <p className="text-[18px] leading-[29px]">
          In no event shall any Dispute brought by either Party related in any
          way to the Site be commenced more than 1 year after the cause of
          action arose.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2 className="text-[19px]">Restrictions</h2>
        <p className="text-[18px] leading-[29px]">
          The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute
          between the Parties individually. To the full extent permitted by law,
          (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b)
          there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a
          class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (c)
          there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a
          purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or
          any other persons.

          Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration
        </h2>
        <p className="text-[18px] leading-[29px]">
          The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the
          above provisions concerning informal negotiations and binding
          arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or
          concerning the validity of, any of the intellectual property rights of
          a Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of
          theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any
          claim for injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be illegal
          or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any
          Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be
          illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court
          of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction
          above, and the Parties agree to submit to the jurisdiction of that
          court.
